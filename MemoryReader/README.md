# FFXIV Mappy (beta)

Be nice, I'm a PHP developer.

## Note:

Once built and run once it will download json data from the ffxivapp repositories. There is a custom signature 
modification in this repo, please copy the `signatures-x64.json` to the build output folder overwriting what 
is currently there. For more information on the ffxiv memory module, visit: https://github.com/FFXIVAPP/sharlayan

## What is this?

It is a tool that reads the FFXIV game memory and tracks enemy and npc locations (npc also includes event objects,
gathering locations, spawn objects and aetherytes)
